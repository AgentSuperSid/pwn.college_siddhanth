# Building On Success
In this challenge we are supposed to execute 2 commands simultaneously using `&&`.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AbuGeEET745iLUYYFf63gY0BMt6.0lM0MDOxwCO1kjNzEzW}`

- It was pretty straightforward just type `/challenge/first-success && /challenge/second`.

```bash
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
Nice chaining! Flag: pwn.college{AbuGeEET745iLUYYFf63gY0BMt6.0lM0MDOxwCO1kjNzEzW}

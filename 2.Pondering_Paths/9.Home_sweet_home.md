# 9.Home sweet home
-The challenge was basically to write the absolute path but by using lesser that 4 characters. For absolute we usually used to use */* which would add an extra character.
-So by using ~ initially it will automatically get expanded as /home/hacker and this will be taken as an absolute path even though */* wasn't used first.

## My Solve

hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run /~
The argument you provided is not under your home directory!
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/~
Writing the file to /home/hacker/~!
... and reading it back to you:

## Answer
**Flag:** pwn.college{goxf8AxR1IdgPGJ26yTRrmQn51W.QXzMDO0wCO1kjNzEzW}

-I was thinking if i should go to **/** directory first and then use **~** when they were saying that the argument path should be inside the home directory.
-Then after some attempts i figured out it should be something like **~/**.....
-Then when I tried ~ after that i got the answer.

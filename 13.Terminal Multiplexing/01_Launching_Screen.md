# Launching Screen
In this challenge we should open a **Screen** and then close it to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AqH6JHb6_4_nfrgw1eT7n1vIrd_.0VN4IDOxwCO1kjNzEzW}`

- All I had to do was type `screen` and press `esc`.

```bash
Congratulations! You're inside a screen session!
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{AqH6JHb6_4_nfrgw1eT7n1vIrd_.0VN4IDOxwCO1kjNzEzW}
```

# Setting Variables
- In this challenge we should assign the value *COLLEGE* to the variable *PWN*.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{o2rKGLfOCN9zruHOY4i3tQhNwCj.QX5UTN0wCO1kjNzEzW}}`

- We just have to do what they said, setting *PWN* variable to the value *COLLEGE*.
- This is done by `PWN=COLLEGE`.
  
```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{o2rKGLfOCN9zruHOY4i3tQhNwCj.QX5UTN0wCO1kjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned 
- Usage of `=` in assigning values to variables.

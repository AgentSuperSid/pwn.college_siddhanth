# Learning From Documentation
- This challenge gives us the introduction to the argument usage.

## My Solve
```bash
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Ygi0undsOnTyhYAkZpt0NAQT4-Y.QX0ITO0wCO1kjNzEzW}
```
- All I had to do was follow what they said to do, that is type *challenge/challenge* command with the argument **--giveflag** in order to get the flag
## Answer
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ygi0undsOnTyhYAkZpt0NAQT4-Y.QX0ITO0wCO1kjNzEzW}`

## What I learned
